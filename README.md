**Architecture Overview**
The app is built using a simplified Clean Architecture + MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) approach.

Layers:
Model (BookModel): Represents the data structure of a book.
Service (BookService): Handles API communication and fetches the book data from Open Library.
ViewModel (BookViewModel): Manages app state, logic for fetching books, pagination, and favorites.
View (UI): Displays data to the user, allowing interaction (HomePage, DetailsPage, FavoritesPage).

** Key Decisions**
State Management: Provider was chosen for simplicity and because it integrates well with Flutter‚Äôs reactive nature.

Pagination: The app uses an offset-based pagination approach (?limit=10&offset=n) to load books in chunks.

Favorites: Users can mark/unmark books as favorites. This is managed in memory using a list (favorites) in the BookViewModel.

Later improvements could include saving favorites persistently using libraries like Hive or SharedPreferences.

Navigation: We use named routes (/, /details, /favorites) for clean navigation management.
